EmergenSpeed allows you to input your emergency contact information. Then, with the push of a button, the app will notify all of your emergency contacts with the message YOU want. The app provides built in suggestions, but also allows you to customize a personalized message, already prepared for when you need to send a quick text to multiple people but don't have the time to individually notify everyone.

# How to Use

To see how this app works, sign up for a developers account at https://www.twilio.com/ and open up the script.js file. 
Replace the Authentication token, AccountSID and phone number with the ones associated with your account.
